 ## intent:ask-donate-more
- Would $2.00 be too much to ask?
- Why not $1.75 then? :-)
- Any chance you would consider making a greater donation?
- 0.50 cents would help so much but 0.60 would be even better.
- If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.
- Are you sure you wouldn't want to help a child by donating the full amount?
- How about $1.25?
- For just a mere $1.25 you can save a child's life.
- Would it convince you to donate more if I can assure you that the donation is absolutely secure and will be completely given to a trustworthy, verified fund within Save the Children?
- Is there anything you'd like to ask, or any way I can convince you to send a little more to Save the Children in the interests of the kids they work to help?
- How about $.50?
- Well nice talking to you so I am going to Donate 70% and you will do the 30% .
- Good Deal and hope this will help others.
- I'm hoping you'll keep half for you and your own child, and half for Save the Children too!
- Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment, would you like to give more?
- Are you sure you don't want to donate any more?
- Save the Children really appreciates every penny that they get and it really goes to a good cause.
- $1 will help a lot, but $2 would really help them reach kids around the world.
- I would rather get all of the payment too, but helping kids is better than spending that $1 on a candy bar or other snack instead.
- The children will thank you, do you think you can do a little more?
- Now I know I said any amount, but given the great cause this is, can you spare any more today?
- If you'd like to donate a few more cents, that would help even more children get out of poverty and live a much more clearer life.
- Would you be willing to make a pledge to donate at least 100 every month?
- Right now, Save The Children is matching every donation from $10 and up.
- Would you like to increase your donation to $10 to double your help?
- If it's not too much to ask, I would like you to consider donating perhaps more.
- After all, there are children in Syria now growing up facing threats of violence everyday.
- Surely an additional dollar, which we might spend on a cup of coffee or a bag of chips, could more greatly aid them then us.
- Would you be willing to donate a bit more.
- Say $500?
- Would you donate againn in future?
- I already have you down for $0.05.
- Were you willing to pledge more?
- That sounds like a generous donation, of course you could do more.
- I would say 20 dollars.
- It wouldn't hurt to give more.
- Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?
- I\'m sure you could give $2
- You can surely spare $2
- also, i think you should be a little bit more generous, come on bro, 1 dollar wont kill you.

- You know a lot of children in this world go through hardships, and your destiny is determined on where you are born?
- Yeah, so the chances of being born in the United States are very low, but you and I could have been born in a third world country where children are exploited
- There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.
- Millians of syrian children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence
- In 2018 1000 children were killed in violence
- IN 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in violence.
- Most of these children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence.
- ESpecially since children are being specifically targeted for rape and torture.
- Some are being sold to ISIS
- True, but nothing and something are pretty different things.
- Especially to a kid that is facing a future as a sex slave.
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

- I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people.
- I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.
- If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.
- I read an article yesterday that said 1000 children were saved from hunger shelters just by donations from online workers.
- There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.

- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- Its a lot of children that are starving and need our help.
- For example, millions of children in Syria grow up facing the daily threat of violence.
- It is really difficult having to grow up having to worry about basic needs.
- I'm glad you are able to look for what to be grateful for.
- I guess there are more people than we know who grew up with no worries.
- Many children in these countries live in a war zone.
- Places like Syria and parts of Nigeria are so dangerous that children do not have the chance of a happy, healthy life.
- Especially for the children in war zones where they are dying every day because they cannot get enough medical care.
- I am sure that you have seen pictures of the bombing in Syria and the murder of innocent children in places like Nigeria and Somallis where terrorists are bombing their villages.
- These children have no hope except for people like you and I.
- Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need

- Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?
- With no place to live?
- Not everyone has it so it's good that you appreciate it
- my parents were always in a good situation to be able to raise me well.
- but there are a lot of kids in the world who arent so fortunate'
- 1000 children were killed or injured and the donations can address these problems.

- Anything you can add to the donation will go directly to helping them.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- there are many children who suffer today in the world for bread

- Some are born extremely well off, some are born with some opportunities and some are born completely destitute.
- I'd like to talk about children who weren't born with the same as opportunities.
- Particularly children who go hungry everyday and have no place to live.
- How does that make you feel?
- I felt safe and secure in my home.
- That is absolutely wonderful.
- I feel many people take that for granted.
- Not having to worry about those things while growing up.
- It would be great if we could work together to assure that everyone have at least those basic necessities met.
- I feel heartbroken for some of these kids.
- It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- This makes me angry and was wondering if it did the same for you?
- Well one statistic that in 2018 alone over 1,000 children were killed or injured in Syria.
- This charity's goal is to help them out.
- The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.
- Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.
- Everybody deserves the option to be happy.
- We all should have equal opportunity to be happy and succeed in life.
- It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need
- We have many children who starve and die of hunger.
- You donation will stop this from happening and possible save a child's life
- We have not received much support for these children.
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- Your donation could possible go to this problem and help many young children
- Children in underdeveloped countries do not have the support that other kids have and I just want to give them a chance to improve their lives.
- There was a child who died of hunger and I think my donation will help other children.
- I just read that The United Nations estimated last year 25,000 people still die of hunger daily.
- That means more than 9.1 million people die of hunger every year.
- It makes me angry to know of so many children in danger in the world.
- Especially if that story of a child who died makes you angry like me.
- It's so easy we won't even miss it.
- Think of the poor kids in Syria who could get so much for the price of a coffee in Chicago.
- But you have a full time job, food, shelter and I'm sure you have family and friends.
- These kids families were murdered and they live in rubble that used to be their home, nobody to care for them and they only eat what they can find off the street from the dead.
- If they eat at all
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- Can you imagine living in extreme violence?
- Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?
- I understand but these children have even less than us.
- I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.
- I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- Bruce was born to a single mother who was only 14 at the time he came into this world , the girls mother and father were ashamed of her pregnancy and kicked out of the house.
- The founder of save the children heard about the family and learned of Bruces story .
- He came to meet Bruce .
- Bruce went own to join the save the children foundation after he completed college and is helping save children today.
- The owner got involved in Bruces life and sav the children went to work and provide food and cloths and school needs for Bruce .
- Yes he is a force for good and was saved out of tragedy.
- I worry about those kids too, so I understand.
- It's a shame what's going on, I hope the problem gets rectified soon.
- For example,millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- I cannot even begin to imagine that and clean water should be a basic right to every child on this planet.
- I'd like to talk to you about children who are less fortunate.
- Children who suffer from hunger would greatly appreciate a donation
- Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year!
- Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life?
- Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money.
- By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.
- Of course you work for everything you own.
- By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.
- Think about all the stories you hear in the news and on social media about children that need help or have been taken advantage of.
- But one thing is for certain, you will feel good about your donation!
- We should be mad about what is happening to them
- There are children dying in Syria who can benefit from the donation.
- Think about all the children in war torn areas and all of the physical and emotional support they need.
- Its devistating
- I was just thinking about all the kids going back to school and saw a story about places to drop off school supplies for kids in need
- Those kids suffer quite a lot and dont really have anyone to help them.
- I give a lot of money to the children in need, with pain everywhere they are
- Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.
- Actually it breaks my heart to see children in pain.
- There are many kids that still needs help in other parts of the world
- There are many that lives in war zones with no access to food.
- I saw a kid die in my hands.
- Its a shame.
- Can you think about someone else but yourself?
- How do you feel about those who were unluckily born to poor circumstances?
- It will be difficult, but we are focused in reuniting the children with their family.
- The separation should never have happened.
- that good You knew that for every minute that passes, a child under the age of 5 dies as a result of the war in the Middle East
- Yes in developing countries lack of educations for childrens in war zone and even if you taken in syria the millions of peoples meet their daily days by violance but we have a great days so we make that happier and healthier
- Have you heard of children getting separated from their family at the US-Mexico border?
- Children shouldn't be separated from their families.
- It is very heartbreaking to hear, and I'm glad Save the Children stepped in.
- Just found out there are tons of sick kids right now over seas that need help
- It is our moral responsibility to help feed the hungry.
- We are so lucky to live in a country where there is help available to us such as Medicaid, food banks and other organizations to help us.
- It is so unfair that any person in any country can go hungry,
- I hope that each of us can make a conscious decision to start donating some of our paychecks each week to help children and families around the world.
- Yes it is truly up to us to help the millions of children in Syria who have grown up only knowing violence
- Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!
- there are so many wars and so many natural disasters
- I know the commercials are heart wrenching...seeing all those children suffer and hurting.
- It breaks my heart.
- I have a little girl and it only makes me want to do more and more for her.
- Oh, I know children did not ask to grow up in these coditions adults have let them down in so many ways
- So many children die every day due to starvation and acts of violence in these developing countries.
- These children are not given the same opportunity at education as you and I.
- Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve.
- Especially childrens charities, children are so innocent and deserve the best chance at life.
- True, but there are so many innocent little children who don't have access to food or clean water, not to mention basic health needs.
- We are lucky to have help if needed they have no one to turn to.
- A lot of these children don't have people like you in their community.
- There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- Your small donation can address such problems.
- Many of these children don't have the same opportunities as others and live in very difficult conditions.
- I chose those words because across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty and, of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural.
- Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential.
- I wish all kids could have that kind of opportunity.
- It can help a lot of kids - from the hungry in the US, to the children literally being killed in war zones.
- It would help so much.
- Some people are born really well-off.
- Some are born not well-off, but they can reasonably expect enough food to eat and a place to live.
- And there are some who are born so destitute that they can go for several weeks in hunger and/or not have a safe place to live or sleep.
- How does that make you feel?
- I have a friend of mine in another country who lost a child today to hunger
- It's really sad we have the money to just splurge on stuff in our normal every day lives but we can't spend just a few bucks a month or year for the children!
- some people donate whole their life and time.
- In the first two months of 2018, around 1,000 children were killed or injured due to violence there.
- Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease
- They save children from horrible fates like starvation.
- No child should ever lose their life for lack of food.
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence
- Well, lets get specific.
- Have you seen the kids in Syria?
- Those kids are growing up in tents and being bombed every day.
- Still it isn't enough.
- The kids there are struggling.
- True, but there - the kids are lucky to get a meal a day.
- Save the children helps with that.
- I am so livid I just can't stand it right now.
- Parts of this world are so dark...
- how can we sit here and do nothing?
- These poor suffering children!
- Did you know that 5.6 million children die each year due to treatable AND preventable diseases?
- maybe there are children who may die without this money
- Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.
- These children die from hunger daily.
- Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families
- It is I have personally been involved with this charity after finding out that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence
- For example Syrian kids have died in thousands just in 2018 and Save the children is trying to help as much as they can
- I remmember a case of a children that lost his oparents at war in Syria.
- And think of all the kiddies you will be helping!
- Yes children really need your help.
- There are children in war zones and under developed countries just begging for help.
- They help children in war zones.
- These kids really deserve it :)
- In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.
- I loved that they set up shelters that were child friendly because t's so hard for kids to be away from home like that
- It just so sad to see children from developing countries die from easily preventable deseases
- million of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- You said you have a kid.
- Imagine your precious child going through it every day.
- waking up every day being afraid of getting killed
- I usually like to focus on charities that help children since I think they are most vulnerable
- I have a soft heart for children
- It makes my heart happy how people care about children.
- It will guarantee many children's safety
- Children in other countries don't have the advantages that we do such as access to the internet
- Nearly 5.6 million children die each year due to preventable causes.
- You have to think about how helpless children can be.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- If we had more help by people like you.
- These things could be avoided.
- The children we help are in desperate need, however.
- Did you know that in the first two months of 2018, over 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in Syria alone?
- Kids are dying from hunger every minute.
- Don't you want to help stop that?
- There isn't a lot of support for children in developing countries.
- This should make you mad and want to help.
- It's really really sad what's going on over there.
- Those commercials make me so sad!
- In the U.S. and around the world, Save the Children does whatever it takes ??Â¸??Â¸ every day and in times of crisis ??Â¸??Â¸ to ensure children grow up healthy, learning and safe.
- Learn about the places we work, the challenges children face and the results we achieve, thanks to supporters like me and you.
- That is great to hear, but sadly there is not much that that organization can do, as a lot of children in poor countries don't even get the chance to live past the 15 years of age
- I could try to persuade you more, but it seems your mind is fairly set in place.
- Just remember it's not about doing better for ourselves, it's for the next generations that follow us.
- But am upset about something I just learned
- In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.
- This makes me so anger and sad!
- That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!
- I fell so bad about it also.
- I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence
- In developing countries like Syria, millions of children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- I remember seeing ads on the television about it and it breaks my hear to see children so sad and suffering in conditions that they live in.
- I haven't personally witnessed experiences first hand, however, it comes down to basic human needs.
- Vulnerable children in poverty.
- Denied an education.
- Forced to flee violence.
- Orphaned, abused, abandoned.
- Children with no reason to smile.
- No hope for the future.
- Not as much as the starving children in Syria who don't even have a phone/desktop to do this hit.
- I hope you feel guilty for not helping the kids now, because this is just your time.
- It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.
- If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!
- Isn't that amazing?
- Promoting the right's of children that are suffering.
- It makes me so sad to know that some children are having a hard time even finding clean water to drink.
- Those are things I've just always had, so sometimes I feel guilty that I haven't tried to do more to help others.
- It is really so heartbreaking when you see all of these kids not having enough to eat.
- It really breaks the heart.
- They are so little.
- I would hate to think a child would die with no food when I could ask people to help.
- I could not imagine having to watch any child suffer, much less my own.
- Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- In the first two months of this year, 1000 kids were killed in Syria.
- Crazy.
- There are so many relevent issues going on in the world right now its hard to focus on just one.
- There are children out there now without access to housing, clean water, education, and many other things we often take for granted.
- I understand that everyone cannot commit to making a serious donation, but when we think about children suffering, we have a moral imperative to act in their defense.
- OK, I will not force you to make a decision you don't want to.
- I will just ask you to consider how you would feel if your child was danger like many children are.
- Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.
- Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.
- I feel the same way as you do.
- It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.
- It made me both angry and sad.
- I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?
- Did you know that 16,000 children under the age of 5 die each day?
- Most of them die from preventable diseases, too!
- That horrifies me!
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially
- So many kids out there need a home, after all!
- There are so many issues today with children, all over the world!
- For instance, did you know that in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1k children were killed or injured in intensifying violence?
- I have seen kids dying of hunger in those countries at war.It breaks my heart
- They are children.They did not ask fot this.
- Many children in war zones are struggling
- Giving to Save the Children is one of the world's best investments.
- Changing children's lives now.
- Transforming the future we all share.
- Yes they are everywhere.
- I saw a kid die in my hands once.
- It was horrible
- Did you know that in the first 2 months of 2018 alone, 1000 kids were killed or injured in the violence happening in Syria?
- Your donation will help those kids so much.
- You should feel so good donating
- In the first 2 months of 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured.
- Save the Children is an amazing organization.
- The children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- Syrian children have grown up facing daily threat of violence.
- It is so sad that children have to been in the middle of all the hate in the world today.
- It breaks my heart to see and hear of how bad children have to live and what they go thru each and every single day.
- this is the most important thing for them and to make some happy ones
- I know I would feel horrible if any kids in my family/extended family were suffering.
- It breaks my heart to know that while I have so much freedom there are kids that look at a simple meal as a lifesaving chance.
- If only they had parental support, but in war-torn countries like Syria their parents are being killed in wars or are fighting for their country, they have no help and that's why they need your support, please find it in your heart to just give a little bit tonight, that's all I'm asking.
- Children are being hit with bombs they are looking for help in war zones
- Also, when a child is sick, they sometimes don't have the funds for proper healthcare, so unfortunately they die.
- It's really terrible.
- So many children die from hunger, and it's not fair.
- It's so sad that so many children are dying in developing countries and war zones.
- It makes me furious.
- I head of one child who was in the middle of a war-torn city in Syria, who was cut off from food and water, and died.
- In countries like Syria, 1000 children have been killed during the civil war.
- Isn't that insane?
- Adults often can't fend for themselves when there's a crisis, but children are especially vulnerable.
- Every day I watch the news and hear about victims all over the world and feel kind of powerless.
- These children have been victims of war, famine, and poverty.
- You would be shocked at how many children live in poverty here in the United States.
- Can you imagine someone taking your small child away from you and not knowing where they are going, who is going to be caring for them, or if you will ever be able to see them again?
- As a mother, that thought is horrifying.
- I saw a children die once
- He was hungry with no food.
- I was serving in Afghanistan
- why did not you help him?
- I tried to give him my food but it was too late
- More than thousands children have died of hunger in Syria this year.
- We must do something about it
- They are the future you know...
- alot of the children are in war zones and facing daily threats of violence.
- Some of them are basically naked and have nothing.
- Others have no shoes.
- It's really sad, but that's why there are programs out here like us to step in and provide help.
- Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty.
- I believe every child deserves the chance to have food in their bellies and an education to be able to help others when they get to adulthood.
- Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher.
- It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old.
- But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day.
- One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about.
- Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people.
- This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.
- There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.
- For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- The war torn area is just one of many examples of places where kids need support.
- Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.
- You know they're worse off than you, right?
- They have even less than your daughter has.
- Think about those poor kids.
- These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need.
- Look, already in 2018 alone, 1,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- They need your help.
- They need your donation more than you do honestly.
- What is $2 to you when that money can literally save lives over there?
- Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.
- For example,Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
- In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
- It says on their site that in the first two months of this year alone, 1000 children were killed or injured there
- I can't imagine what that's like for the parents.

 ## intent:foot-in-the-door
- The monies will go to a worthy cause.
- Every little bit helps.
- you can donate as much as 2$ or as little as couple of cents.
- Anything between 10 to 50 cents helps.
- Maybe next time you hear about the charity, or if someone asks you to donate something, just give a little each time.
- You can donate as little as you want.
- But it will make a huge difference for those in need.
- But I think most can donate a dollar
- You can give any amount, even as little as $0.01 can help.
- I know that my small donation is not enough,so i am asking you to also donate some small percentage from reward.
- Agree,small amount of money for US can mean a lot for people in third world countries.
- It won't be much but every penny counts.
- We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.
- So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.
- Any amount of donation would help in this cause.
- It's surprising how little can make an impact on these kids.
- It's quick and easy, and even thought it may not seem like a lot of money, I think that every penny counts.
- In places like the middle east or southern Asia, even the smallest donation can go a long way.
- I don't have that information at hand, but even .30 cents goes a long way!
- I understand but even the smallest amount would be a BIG help.
- even a few cents can add up!
- If you could donate a small amount from your task payment, it would be big help to these unfortunate little people.
- Everything helps!
- Every donation helps.
- Any amount will help.
- Every penny counts!!
- a couple of cents or a couple of dollars might not make a difference in your life but it can make a huge impact on some child's life
- Every little bit helps.
- Even a small amount!
- Every little bit helps!
- Something as small as .05 could help.
- Every little bit help.
- Right, every little bit helps.
- That's fine any amount helps.
- Any amount we can collect for them is welcome.
- It is a good charity and any little bit will help
- These organizations only ask for a small amount that we may spend on coffee each day or snacks we don't need.
- It only takes pocket change for us to help out.
- Well,in America, of course that's nothing.
- But in developing countries it could be huge.
- I know how hard it can be to give, but it's amazing how a small amount can make such a big difference
- Even if it's small.
- Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.
- Small donations really do add up and make a difference.
- Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.
- Even just a small amount makes a difference?
- Even just a small donation helps.
- Not any specific amount, anything can be good, no matter small or big.
- just a few dollars, while lyou can donate as much as you like, every little bit means a better life for these children
- Every bit helps?
- It can be any amount from just $0.10 to the full payment!
- Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.
- Can you try to even donate 1 cent?
- I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.
- You can donate as much or as little as you want.
- The cost of a cup of coffee even.
- Just donating a small portion of your earnings are a big help.
- Seriously though,  just think about giving up 1 cup of coffee/drink a day or just donating though the link at the end of this task what you would be making off of it.
- Every little bit helps.
- Small donations are better than nothing at all!
- You Know small donations can help a lot of children and their families
- Even small amounts will definitely help
- They know that any small amount can help.
- I can assure you if you donate as little as a penny to this charity you can be part of the solution to put an end to children's struggles from all over the world.
- Even small donations go a long way
- I think it speak volumes about you as a person to be willing to give of yourself even if it is a small amount!
- I think you can donate as little as one cent.
- As little as $0.05 would be of great help or how much ever you would like to donate from this bonus.
- You can offer even the smalles amount from today's pay, like $0.05.
- They give you an option at the end of the HIT to donate even 0.01 would be very helpful....
- a penny couldn't hurt could it?
- Anything will help.
- Are you certain?
- Just a small donation can make a large impact on the entire life of a child and allow them to receive proper medical care and education, food and safety.
- Even if you may have a few pennies that are left around can be collected and help the children. Would that be something you are willing to do?
- Anything, even a few cents, will definitely help in the long run.
- Even a few pennies tha tyou will earn from this task will help.
- That sounds wonderful, doesn't it?
- And we're not asking for a lot, just some or all of your incoming payment for your task.
- Imagine how helpful even a small fraction of that money would be to these kids
- Remember every penny Donated is another step towards bettering a child's future
- well, every cent counts that's what I say or a penny saved is a penny earned either way it works out the same
- Just a small  donation of .50 could help imact a childs life.
- I am only asking for a very small donation of .05
- Yes that is what I believe to, We wouldn't even notice 10 cents we spend so much on coffee little things the .10 cents is nothing.
- Bummer, even 5 cents of your pay out helps!!!
- Please consider giving even 5 cents.
- Again, look over the charity information and consider a small donation
- Like I said even a small donation of 5 cents is tremendous to them.
- It is a worthwhile cause and every penny has a significant impact on these children's lives.
- Even a small donation can have a large impact in impoverished areas.
- $2 you won't miss.
- At all!
- I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more
- You don't have to give much.
- A few cents a month is all it takes to help change a child's life.
- But it's only .30 of the money you are saving.
- Your right, but I'm not asking for much.
- It's only .30 cents and It will do alot to help.
- I know, it can be hard to donate. especially in today's society, but a tiny amount, even less than a dollar, can go a long way
- maybe just $0.01?
- It still will go a long way.
- That $0.01 donation will go a long way to helping children.
- And the great thing for us is that even a very small donation goes a long way due to the number of people who can donate!
- You're absolutely right-  sometimes we don't realise it, but what seems like a little bit of moeny to us can make a big difference to them.
- I worked in Africa earlier this year and the difference a few dollars can make to people over there is unbelievable.
- We can all do something - donate a little bit or volunteer to try to help.
- I mean $1 to you and I in the United States is really not much but to children in developing countries it is huge when all added up together for the Save the Children program
- Yes it makes me very sad too, but it is also nice to be able to help small even small amount.
- It might look small but I am sure it will end up big
- And for some countries even few dollars is a big thing, like for getting vaccinated.
- It only needs to be a small donation and it will be deducted out of your task pay.
- Are you sure, you can do as little as 5 cents???
- Every penny can make a huge difference even if it doesn't feel like it.
- Just $1.00 could help tramendously.
- Can't you spare even a small donation?
- I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.
- And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.
- Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?
- They also make it really easy to donate, and every little bit helps.
- I'm not as well, but I figured one cent would still go a long way.
- And sometimes even a small help is a lot, thinking many others will do the same.
- A little bit can go a long way!
- Anything would help even small donations add up when everyone pitches in.
- You can do that locally for certain, but time is money, and right now just a dollar would go a long way in saving lives.
- But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.
- Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!
- It would be worth even 5 or 10 cents to know these children are getting the basic things in life
- if you think about it 5 cents will buy pretty much nothing anymore but to this charity it means so much more.
- every little bit helps.
- I know they appreciate any donation big or small
- You can donate as little as a $1
- Every little bit will help the children we are trying to save.
- Even a bit?
- Any amount over 0$ can be donated, even as little as a few cents and everything helps!
- Even a dollar or less can be used to do great things.
- Small donations add up quickly.
- I hate to push but is there any chance you could give just $0.25?
- Today I am asking if you would consider even a small donation to STC, even $0.05 would help.
- Your help could really make a difference in a child's life, think of a child who didn't have enough to eat, just a small bit of help may have saved them, are you sure you're not interested?
- I'm not asking you to donate years of your life, just a couple of cents if possible, is that something you could possibly do tonight?
- You're probably on a computer right now, so you probably have quite a bit of money yourself, don't you think you could spare maybe 25 cents for some needy children around the world?
- Well with our current president it's not likely they're going to be brought the US, so they need any help they can get, and 25 cents might not seem like a lot, but if 10000 people donated 25 cents then the impact will be huge.
- I understand it may not seem like a lot, but it can really make a difference
- Even a couple of cents.
- Whatever you can afford.
- I wouldn't suggest all of your payment, but just a small amount would help
- A few bucks goes a long way in these places.
- Small donations will indeed help a lot of children and their families.
- Even a small donation makes a big difference.
- Even the smallest donation would make a difference to a child in need.
- but a few cents can go a long way
- Just 77 cents could help a refugee family and I will match the donation.
- Can you just commit to 10 cents?
- Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars.
- every little bit counts!
- even something small would help.
- Even 1 penny? 1 penny would be minimal and would greatly help.
- It doesn't even take much.
- A couple cents could really help these kids!
- Small amounts actually do go far.
- A couple bucks and it's a few meals for someone.

 ## intent:logical-appeal
- These children really need the assistance.
- Child sponsorship works like a way of giving and that connects one compassionate person like you with one child in need.
- Sponsoring a child gives the chance to grow up healthy, educated and safe ??Â¸??Â¸ forever changing the course of their life and future.
- Ya.. It will definitely work and save the children's future..
- Just think of everyone who could donate a dollar and help kids in other countries little by little. You're an awesome person.
- It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.
- Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.
- But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.
- Donations are extremely important in order for children to have their rights to healthcare, education, safety, etc
- If you were to donate you would be making a huge impact for these children and on the world
- A donation of 0.60 can address these problems
- Before you donate I just want u to think about how much money you spend on unnecessary items like eating out, snacks, going out.
- Money can be used in so many more meaningful ways..
- YOu donation is going to help address these problems.
- I simply want you to know what a great thing you are doing by donating and that your donation of 0.60 is going to help so many.
- It's a fact that small donations by large numbers of people can have an impact.
- I think you sell people short, especially since we are talking about numbers in a table.
- People can see where the numbers go.
- I'm not sure what 'legalese' you refer to.
- And these statements are not summaries.
- They detail how every dollar is spent, as required by law.  =)
- Same here, they have many option to help, We can donate or We can participate in their events
- Yes, you are helping to ensure children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.
- Children really are the future and if humans have any hope of surviving in the long run, we need to raise our children to see the good in this world and help others
- Charity is very important and everyone should have a fighting chance in life.
- When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.
- We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.
- I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.
- It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.
- I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment.
- Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.
- Your donation will help ensure children's rights to health, education and safety.
- Your donation can help children in need reach their full potential and what's really more important that our children as they are our future.
- Your donation goes a long way too!
- You know 30 cents may not seem like a lot to you, but to a child who is hungry and sick, it can mean the difference between life and death.
- Your donation is going to help a child eat, receive an education, and have access to life-saving medicine.
- 155 million children benefited last year, with your help we'll reach even more!
- There is no greater service than to help.
- The children need your help.
- Please say yes to their most basic needs.
- That is how much our help is needed.
- Your donation can address such problems.
- And the money raised helps feed and clothe them.
- A donation could help these children greatly.
- It is a great charity that does a lot of great work around the world.
- You will also feel good about what you have done.
- There is no better feeling than helping another person.
- I love getting the word out there on this charity.
- I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.
- Children should be a priority in the world.
- They are our future.
- Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.
- We save children.
- Did you know that 90 cents out of every dollar goes directly towards helping a child?
- I know it is hard to trust people now a days, but think of it this way.
- You are donating money you don't even have yet so it is not like you are missing something.
- Donations make a huge difference in the lives of these kids.
- Your help will give them access to food, healthcare, education, and safety, among other things.
- It will make a big difference to Save the Children.
- The organization has done wonders for kids, saving them from everything from violence to starvation.
- We as people have a moral responsibility to help them, and when we have extra, there's no better place to put it than in the hands of a trustworthy charity that will use it to save kids.
- And the children are the ones who need it the most!
- to help some of the kids is the biggest satisfaction you took in life
- in the first months of 2018 1000 children were killed or injured in intensifying violence and your donation can help to address this problem
- as i said even a couple of cents would help!
- You're the part of the solution!
- We can't help everyone, but we can focus one cause at a time.
- A cause that you believe in.
- I try to do the same if I have the extra money.
- Usually it is not something I am a strong believer in though.
- I really like helping others that in third world countries that have no idea what wealth is.
- These donations will be able to help so many children!
- This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.
- Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.
- A donation for a child is very neccesary
- I think you can still make a difference.
- If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.
- Everyone should be responsible of this issue
- We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well
- Your donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc. It will make a real difference in the world.
- If you donate you can help many children.
- It doesn't take much to make a difference.
- I certainly am not wealthy but still try to make donation as often as I can.
- There are some wealthy people that are great philanthropists, but I think more people like you and I are needed to make even small donations.
- I think we are really part of the solution this way.
- The good thing about it is when you want to donate on websites they usually have a minimum, but with HITs there is no minimum amount
- Exactly and they pay to workers good enough so they will be willing to donate.
- It is worth a lot.
- Specially when it is really trustworthy organization
- for just a small amount you can help a child starving in Africa, and other children who are homeless
- You will be helping to feed hundreds of chldren for just pennies on the dollar
- Your donation would make a real impact on many children, who have no acess to medical care, clothing, or education
- The more I read about them, the more I am thinking that they are a very worthy charity organization.
- It looks like they do fantastic work right here at home as well as globally.
- I think it would be really touching if you did and a great little one of those 'be kind to others' moments kinda like sneaking a quarter into someones parking meter just because, and every cent goes to those kids.
- You can help out A LOT by donating!
- They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.
- This is your chance to do some good.
- Everyone can help.
- All of us should be in this world together.
- I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?
- I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.
- Volunteering and helping others with your time and effort is great, but in the meantime how can you help?
- Donations let you help until you have the time and focus to knock those activities off your list.
- Would you help out in this small way?
- Your donation would be helping children really even a little bit helps so much.
- It would do a great help with your donation.
- Your donation would be a small part in keeping the children safe from the violence.
- I feel that it would be easy to donate.
- I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.
- I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.
- Yes any donations made to helpless children make a real impact on their life.
- Not many kids get a real shot and they all deserve one If I had a chance to change a childs life foe the better and didn't I would not be able to live with myself.
- Yiur will go to help other just like that right now are looking or in room by themselves hoping for a miracle .
- Will you be that miracle and help a child like Bruce today?
- Helps to bring awareness.
- help the children. in the word
- I think out of all charities saving the children is most important one as children make the future.
- Hope you agree
- I say, if you have enough than give to others
- basic education is very important to have a good future
- I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.
- I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.
- People far away need help just as much as people close to us.
- You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies
- I think that is an excellent amount and would benefit Save the Children.
- Your donation will make an impact to better childrens' live around the world.
- It is very thoughtful to donate to causes that benefit disadvantaged children.
- Your donation means a lot to that child in India
- That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children.
- By people like you, making a a donation of just $1 a day, you can feed a child for a month.
- Together, we're changing children's lives and the future we all share.
- Your donation will help children who cant afford help and are living through hell on earth.
- Don't you want to be part of the solution by giving as much money as possible to Save the Children so they can help as many children as possible?
- Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money.
- Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis.
- Save the Children will even let you know about the specific child that your money is helping.
- So you will really get to know that one child.
- It's not just some faceless organization with faceless non existant children.
- Everything is completly real and on the up and up.
- It is a great social cause that is worth donating to!
- Think about how much money you spend on non essentials in your life.
- Now think about sacrificing just one of those to help out a child.
- Every bit helps.
- You will not see how it directly impacts one child, but instead think about focusing on how your donation would impact multiple children and families!
- You will instantly feel better about your decision once you do.
- You can actually donate some of your earrings to them which honestly any little bit cna help them at this point.
- Your dontation can help the problem
- We all do, but for now, there are children in need and this organization does amazing work
- I would appreciate it if some of the funds could be donated.
- Thank you, it will help out children in need.
- I think save our children is incredibly important, becuase children are the ones who need it most.
- With save the children, money is most important, since they can use it to get all of the necessary needs for children met.
- One of the kids you could be helping could be the next president or osmething!
- I remember reading about some questionable charities following hurricanes in Haiti and Puerto Rico.
- It's a bummer when that money gets siphoned off.
- I just looked up Save the Children on Charity Navigator and they give the org an 88.3 rating out of 100 including a 97 for transparency.
- I like to think so, yes.
- I know that organizations always stress that every little bit counts.
- I'd like to think that even a few cents from a lot of people would be helpful.
- Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.
- Yeah I stronlgly believe we should all pitch in and help.
- We all need money, but this is a special cause and the money is not too much.
- It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.
- I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding.
- If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation
- If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless.
- We talk a lot about children in other countries, but there's a lot of need for American children too.
- there are the future of the word
- Donations are their main source of income.
- however any donation helps, even just 1 dollar.
- You have a chance to help today by donating even a small amount of your pay.
- Children are our future and I believe in charities helping children.
- a little help can make a big difference, sometimes a family can live with just $30.00 per month
- I think It is good to know donating through this task won't hurt your reward
- Its very important what they do.
- Kids does not care where they from
- All kids need help.
- Even a little would help.
- Even the smallest donation can make a big impact on many children and families.
- The money will have a large impact.
- I know normally I am too but I was convinced to research them once by a very giving friend and I found that they do a lot of awesome work and a big majority if not all donations go back into the charity and lining someones pocket
- Any little bit helps.
- You are helping to small childrens for their studies,etc
- Ya if everyone is ready to donate something what i someone having is we can able to control the poor and we have some pride
- How much money do you spend on unnecessary stuff like a bag of snack or candy?
- Think about that and from what you spend on candy and snacks can be money that goes to a child in real need.
- It is a wonderful feeling to help someone and I'm glad that you feel the same way.
- I bet others you know will do the same when they see you donating to a great cause.
- It's going to a really good cause!
- I think the work they do is great.
- Helping kids in impoverished nation is a really noble thing to do.
- It would be easy for you to get it back but for the children, this would be huge
- It seems like a great cause.
- yes there are so many in terrible need
- That's another great cause
- Most people find they get great satisfaction from helping someone out.
- You might find that you will eel the same way.
- Your donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.
- Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.
- It is the right thing to do.
- That helps people directly in your community.
- No need to feel guilty.
- People don't have a choice of who or where they are born to.
- Those of us who got lucky, can always lend a hand in our own ways.
- They are and I'd like to try getting more people to be aware of them and maybe help.
- And I just learned today that they have partnerships that match individual donation - so every amount a person givves is actually doubled.
- I think that is important, as it will help the children grow up with a better chance of being successful.
- I love that Save the Children goes to a lot of places to help with things like this.
- I would highly recommend it
- they are good too, but this one I prefer
- St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues
- I think we should use Save the Children this time for a more global effort though
- And it could seriously help several children in countries that don't have it.
- I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.
- Any donation we give will make an impact around the world.
- I wish they didn't have to spend their monies on commericals but it is the only way to get their name out there.
- I know money is tight.
- It sure is for me too.
- I only ask you to think about whether you buy any unnecessary things like a starbucks coffee every day.
- Donating any amount will make a difference, every little donation adds up!
- Something simple and easy to fix.
- Save the Children donations go straight to the needy.
- There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.
- We all play a role in helping this cause save lives.
- You donation combined with others always makes a difference.
- It could do alot of good for Save the children.
- The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.
- Small changes lead to big results.
- There is so much that could be done..
- between preventing the spread of aids, reducing the infant mortality rate with proper education and vaccinations, and ensuring access and aid to proper nutrition so many children could be saved.
- And yes, it could seem like the aid is a drop in a bucket.
- However, if we can move the scale one iota and can consider that what that represents is one child having a week of meals or a healthy 3 months than wouldn't you agree that that would be worth any aid that we could provide?
- They have managed to single handedly reduce the infant mortality rate by 62 percent, can you believe that?
- Pretty spot on with the name, right?
- It's definitely challenging when confronted with the reality of giving of ourselves as opposed to the hypothetical.
- But I would suggest that you make the leap.
- In reality, all this would cost is the time you've spent hear.
- But oh buddy, think about what you would gain?
- The peace of mind that comes with knowing that a baby girl in Uganda gets to live for another year or a little boy in Syria gets fed when he didn't think he would have another meal this week.
- It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children
- ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives
- When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !
- $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children
- Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.
- Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life
- I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.
- My husband had family in syria when the attacks where happening and I can tell you that not being able to do anything was the worst feeling in the world, but knowing that charities like save the children exist was a relief
- I do.You should that too.I am sure you are spending money in things you do not really need
- I donate evry chance that I have.Every change money I get from the groceries I put it on a bucket and donate it at the end of the month.Many children needs your help!!
- There are so many charities too, but I believe that children are the future, and we need to do what we can to help them have fulfilling lives
- Time and money these days can be scarce!
- But think about the little things you buy, and maybe one week, instead of buying that bad of chips or cup of coffee, donate it to the children
- the children are our future and need the chance to have a full life
- Is a trustable fund.
- maybe you will reconsider, acting today is the best way to directly help children and families in need.
- That's alot of help, how bout it?
- Literally every penny helps these children.
- I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.
- Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.
- Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.
- They lead Head Start and Early Head Start programs in this country which really ensure that kids get a great start in their educations
- your donation will make such a huge impact for some children
- And you can also protect those children if you donate to our fund! YOU can make a difference
- Yes, it is a very noble cause
- They can do a lot of things with your donation.
- See, Cassidy, no single one of us can fix all the problems in this world.
- There is too much suffering, too many children growing up in poverty and trauma.
- But together, if we stick together, if we put our money together, you'd be surprised how much we can change in this world.
- How many lives we can help.
- You mentioned earlier that you believe children to be one of the world's most important assets.
- It's for a great cause.
- Children are the future and unfortunately too many of them don't get the quality of life that we take advantage of today.
- Sometimes we're in a better place and we have to do what we can to help their conditions a little bit.
- Even little bits can go a long way, you know?
- It's not like we really get the choice of how/when/where we are born.
- It's a matter of chance.
- It's unfair to be born into conditions like that.
- Every day, 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from preventable causes.
- Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve.
- We're talking about children in need.
- Dying, when the world knows how to save them.
- The world's children deserve better and you're making a difference.
- How much will you spend on a snack or a drink today?
- Then ask yourself how much of that could have saved a life.
- Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty.
- When you focus on children in rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4.
- Through our education, protection and emergency programs, we reached 638,000 kids in 2016 alone.
- The parents never have to pay anything or worry about anything but their child.
- Big issues are going on.
- I'm pretty sure we can and i'm pretty sure that you buy frivolous things that you don't need when the money can be going towards a good cause.
- This isn't my cause, I need to get it through to peoples heads that this is important.
- I'm not trying to get money from you in the streets for my own cauase this is for something bigger than you or I
- But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.
- I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.
- No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...
- I am still thinking, though, that the small donations made from these hits are so easy to donate and can really add up if we all pitch in together!
- You can even just give a very small portion of your compensation from this hit.
- Anything is helpful.
- Children need as much protection as they can get, and every cent donating actually makes a huge difference in their lives.
- I think it's important for those of us in a first world country to help, but it's also so easy to overlook these things.
- It's not that we don't all have our own struggles, but it's just on a completely different level.
- This really is a great place to donate to.
- I am impressed they are so responsive.
- I am not sure what I would do if I had a child in need.
- This is really going to make a difference in these children's lives.
- Every little bit makes a difference.
- When you have people who are so poor, it's amazing what a tiny amount can do.
- Even the little bit you donate from your earnings can go a long way to making a difference for a child.
- Even small amounts make such a big difference when they are added up.
- That's why it does make such a difference to even do small things.
- You do what you can, and that is all that matters.
- But you should feel good about this little amount.
- And these small things just make such a difference.
- It should be. But with people helping it can at least make a difference.
- I think everyone can do their part.
- Also, I agree, the gov't should do more.
- It will really help the kids in need!
- Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better.
- It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children.
- You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does.
- I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?
- It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity.
- It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact.
- I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund.
- I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it.
- I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation.
- I think most people would help just to help.
- I think that would be a more effective message sometimes.
- Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help.
- I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it.
- At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity.
- Your small donation could help at least one of these children live a life without fear.
- I love the idea of helping others also, any little way that I can.
- They are a huge advocate to children.
- They believe that children make up 20% of our population but are 100% of our future and I couldn't agree more.
- That's why it's so important to do research before donating.
- It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.
- Super helpful.
- That\'s good to hear that it\'s not all about filling some people\'s pockets.
- It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.
- I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.
- I know that any small donation counts, because the more individuals donate the more impact they can make.
- It really does.
- It's difficult to know nowadays if your money is actually going to the children.
- Save the Children seems to be a very trustable fund.
- Your donation will help make these children's lives better in some way.
- There are so many issues in this world it is hard to do something about or figure out how to help but this is a step in the right direction.
- There are so many shady charities out there that I think a lot of people are afraid to donate because they do not know where their money is going, but Save the Children is a great and trustworthy one.
- While that is possible in a local community, it fails to take into account the suffering of kids in developing countries around the world, a specialty of Save the Children.
- Save the Children maximizes the efficiency of donations so that every dollar makes a difference.
- One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.
- Even a little can do a lot.
- A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.
- Even small donations, added together, can make a tremendous difference.
- They are only able to help when people donate.
- I am glad to share this iinformation.
- I feel that it is an important organization.
- LOL but after reading up on this they said every penny helps.
- As you know, children can be extremely helpless, especially in third world countries, so they deserve all the help they can get.
- $5 could make a huge different in a lot of kids lives.
- It benefits every where not just war torn countries
- Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.
- I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.
- Anything you could get in donations would certainly help.
- It doesn't have to be a full $500 donation.
- I mean, we already spend money on small snacks or a coffee we could forgo, why not give it to a charitable cause?
- A little goes a long way :)
- Yeah, it really is humbling to watch society ban together and help each other!
- Either way, I'm sure Save the Children will appreciate your donation, and be able to save many more children in the future.
- Well that can make a difference in a children life
- It will everything helps
- Results like these are only possible because of giving people like you.
- Whether you give a little or a lot.
- Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.
- Most people would not even notice the money missing.
- Its very important.
- Provide health assistant for kids in need
- Every child must have health care and food to put in their bellies
- THanks to Save the children.
- The number of death worlwide has been reduced
- I am sure that you should be spending money in something you dont really need
- You would be helping some children who desperately need it
- Animals are like children.
- Making a small donation today will indeed help children and their families in such sad situations.
- this is very important for my life and for my family to help not only our own people but also everybody who needs tons of help
- there are needs for my help
- I understand and I do not want to take up too much of your time.
- But please know that this organization ehlps children on every continent but Antartica.
- Charity is very important.
- Any little bit helps.
- Everything really helps out.
- So you really understand kids!
- I like this charity because they make it so easy to give any amount.
- Every little thing does make a difference.
- Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?
- not as much as they should.
- The children need your help to ensure that they have a fighting chance at their future.
- You can help care for them medically and ensure they have the education needed to succeed in life.
- Through child sponsorship, you can change a child's life, as well as your own ??Â¸??Â¸ all for about $1 a day.
- This will help many kids!
- It's a great NGO that is really making a difference in developing countries.
- All of the children must be taken care of.
- I can tell you that your donation right now will make a tangible impact for the world
- This task makes it really easy for everyone.
- That is enough to signifigantly help a child for several weeks while it is just a week's worth of coffee for you.
- Your donation would be of great help and most would go directly to helping these kids.
- Meanwhile, you could feel great about helping those kids who really need your support!
- Your donation will be very meaningful to needy children.
- Donations made from people like you can directly improve the lives of thousands of children all over the world.
- Donating your payment from this task to Save the Children would make a big difference in a child's life today.
- You said earlier you believe children in need deserve help from others.
- Save the Children is a very reputable charity and your donation will mean so much!
- They are a blessing to humanity
- Thats actual help.
- They really make a difference.
- I see it with my own eyes
- Because you can use some of that money to donate to Save and Children?
- Donations to this charity are essential to ensure at-risk children receive health care, education, safety and much more.
- This donation will aid in giving at-risk children a chance for hope.
- Your donation would make a difference to children among 120 countries, including the United States.
- Your .30 donation will certainly assist these children.
- See, I believe that the children are our future.
- If we don't help them now, they won't have the life they deserve.
- One could be the next president or something!
- I do agree the money should go more towrads the whole family, but some children have lost their families, and have been left with nothing.
- They may end up being homeless and going to food pantries.
- Maybe we could prevent that from happening
- I think that any donation to anyone is helpful in this world.
- It should be specialized
- You make a very good point, sir, but what if everyone felt that way!
- then the children would get nothing!
- well like I said, any donation is a good donation.
- Your donation will help to ensure children's rights to healthcare, education, safety, etc
- Yes, I sure hope we are able to raise a lot of money for this very worthy cause.
- Your individual donation will help individual children and their families.
- What if I were to tell you that 100% of your donation would go directly to helping one child?
- I agree donating locally is also important.
- However, there are so many children that could benefit from just pennies.
- It will go to a trustable fund.
- You have the ability to sponsor at child in the US!
- We spend money on so many little things each day and we have the moral responsibility to help.
- This can go to sponsor a child in your town.
- These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you.
- A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want.
- We do it for them, not for ourselves.
- And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do.
- As you can see, $1 will change their world.
- It's great to help.
- I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?
- Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?
- These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.
- Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?
- This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.
- It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?
- Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?
- $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.
- You're helping a lot of good kids who really, really need it.
- Just think of it this way, instead of getting your morning coffee, or that bag of chips at lunch, you could donate $2 today and help ensure that 3 children get the care they need and food in their stomachs.
- The money would at least go to a good cause.
- If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!
- It is very sad, but with the help of so many millions of caring people we are able to enrich the lives of so many.
- Well, each day children are able to get such needs met by the generosity of those even with donations as small as the cost of about $1 a day.
- A little goes such a long way!
- I can't give you too many details, but trust me, donating the entire 2 would GREATLY benefit you.
- Not to mention the satisfaction of helping a charity that actually does good work.
- You'll be really happy you did, trust me.
- Save the children.
- they need your help.

- (Or at least I hope)
- I wonder why this chat won't end
- Yea sure, go ahead
- ok, please ask
- i always thought that the money goes for other things and not the children , but i am spectral about this.
- things must be always clear to the public eyes .

- Did you have any interesting dreams?
- I've never even heard of it before today which is pretty sad.
- Hmmm, I wonder if this is what that is?

- i love that idea too!
- now everyone has an opportunity.
- U.S. How about you?
- Think they matched us with our complete opposites? :P
- Haha I am trying to figure out if you're a bot.

- I'm working for Save the Children charity!
- Take your time.
- I'm here whenever you are ready
- Well I wouldn't ask more than what a candy bar costs, I know we live in hard times right now.
- It's worth it you know?
- ohh that is really sad to hear.
- Ok so let me tell you this.
- Let me tell you why.
- I was meaning to offend you.
- I was speaking for all people including myself.
- Lets look at in another way..
- Im sorry if i am coming off that way.
- That is not my intention.
- I am sorry i took so much of your time.
- It's awful.
- It seemed grimy not to
- It's not an argument.
- The merit of the cause is an entirely different matter?
- Hmm, hope you don't ever need help one day...
- I usually like to help financially too, since I do not have many off days to join event.
- I believe that is a big thing to do
- I believe they an amazing organization.
- It truly will go to a good cause.
- I have no other information.
- They don't say who the money is going to.
- I don't like children but perhaps you do.
- This is the only one that's available in this context.
- We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.
- It's not like either of us can do much with that either.
- I actually didn't think of it like that.
- I don't know if that's really okay to do though.
- Really relevant.
- Oh, I didn't think of it like that either.
- I always picture like you said about your boss, one kid.
- I always forget that kids turn into adults, i mean not that part, but the whole part where they are all apart of the community! :)
- Gah!
- I just copied and pasted what they said.
- Aha their are 10 minimum chat turns required, we are almost there.
- This charity seems to have children's best interests at heart.
- Now, how do we submit this hit ?
- I think that is awesome.
- I had no idea they operated in the USA also.
- I always thought these organizations focused on other countries
- I really wish more people could understand the importance of helping other, less fortunate then ourselves.
- I completely understand that some expenses do occur in a non-profit, but with 90% going directly to the children, I feel pretty good about it.
- Please ask any questions you may have.
- I want you to feel comfortable knowing your donation is really going to help children.
- Who knew 30 cents could do so much!?
- What more can we do for the least of these?
- Gods love knows no boundaries.
- I just know it!
- It means alot to this rganization.
- i donate every Christmas
- the happiness of others is a special sadisfaxion
- I'd like to talk about children.
- That's understandable.
- We all do what we can to help each other.
- My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.
- Wonder how that will work.
- Yeah, same.
- I assume it will be deducted from any bonuses they decide to give.
- Sounds good to me lol
- Alright, awesome, guess that's it then?
- Ah, yeah I just counted mine as well. Well, unless, you want to donate more, I think we're pretty much done here.
- Im good with that as well.
- Thanks for your quick responses btw.
- A lot of the time, these things don't go very smoothly since you have to wait a while for a response.
- Yeah, true, it's terrible.
- Thanks for your help and have a good Turk day :D
- Other than it mentioned today of course.
- Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?
- yeah..
- I do..
- yah?
- me also, do you know how much a candy bar costs
- yes those are the exact prices, should we donate that much?
- do you ever get tired of being awesome?
- thats cool, it seems hard?
- me too, DONT BETRAY MY TRUST
- I go aroudn telling people about the charity to see if they would like to help out.
- Yes it is!
- That sounds like a great idea!
- It depends on the charity.
- Some of them are scams I think.
- I would be willing to consider that.
- Alright, 20 cents out of the whole task payment amount.
- We could all do better, I suppose.
- 32 and 29 a boy and a girl and 4 grand kids 3 girls and 1 boy ages 6 to 14.
- Unfortunately they all live far away.
- And you?
- That was a hectic but really fun time for me and my kids.
- Yours is so much more hands on and personal i really admire your dedication because you also donate your time and yourself and it sets a good example for your children to Kudos to you.
- Not officially I am kind of the one that even strangers come up to and talk to when something is going wrong in their life and I try to encourage and comfort them and point them to a helping hand if I know of one.
- Like a shelter or a free counseling place or a food bank.
- Be specific in what your asking?
- Because you keep asking the same question for someone that conversing about donating to a charity.
- Its almost like you want to see paper work proof, I told you where your donation goes either you want to donate or not?
- URL go check it out.
- yes it is a organization do you know more info
- It makes me sad as well.
- I am so happy to hear that.
- yes!
- Isn't it wonderful!
- However, it is completely up to you!
- Your time is valuable.
- Absolutely.
- I think it is important to teach our kids from a young age that giving back to others in need is very gratifying and important.
- Okay sounds good.
- I wonder how much 50 cents converts to for them.
- It is probably at least like 5 dollars.
- That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.
- Okay, well I am supposed to ask you how much of your payment you would like to donate.
- Anywhere from zero to the full amount.
- So I am to understand you do not wish to help any of them?
- Okay, well let me give you some details about the charity so we can finish out this conversation.
- we need 10 chats each to complete this hit
- sorry, i meant  URL
- I know, and I'm not really sure if they would deduct any real money.
- Many times they say they will and use their own funding based upon our replies.
- Anyways, I believe we've chatted 10 times.
- Hopefully our government will do something rather than relying on those of us who are moral to donate.
- How is the weather for you?
- Which charity was the flyer from?
- I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.
- I believe it would be a valuable experience.
- And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.
- That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.
- Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.
- I definitely agree with all those points.
- Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.
- tell to family and friends is a first step
- do you want some info?
- If you could please ask you friends and family to help?
- Convince them that they waste too much money on unnecessary stuff like snack and candy.
- They could be helping people with their money'
- Any other questions?
- yes it does
- yes again yhanks
- alright i believe that;'s it
- Family all grown up.
- You will?
- So do you live in the US?
- I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT!
- Where are you?
- Van couver in the US?
- Is that in Washington state?
- I don't work cause I already retired.
- I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.
- LOL
- Just happy to be through with working.
- What do you do for work and do you like it?
- I hope you find something soon.
- Stupid
- I hope you consider them and decide they are worthy
- Wow.
- I just realized I sound like a telemarketer!
- I am glad the Researchers are helping too!
- Make it a great day!
- I have done it this way before and encourage you to do the same.
- Skipping my candy bar today and feeling great!
- well if your making that much off one hit on mechanical turk, I need to switch professions
- Right?
- too busy
- You know once the news media goes away I think people have a tendency to forget about how severe the impact was, but it took years and years after Katrina, remember that.
- Kind of sad how bad it got down there, but also amazing how everyone came together to help out.
- My favorite charity is Save The Children.
- Bucket lists are all well and good but sometimes we help out now.
- You do not have to do anything else.
- I gave what was given to me .
- It's a very valuable cause, and afterall, they have won up to 7 awards.
- I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.
- I'm glad you're so welling to help, but I would feel bad just to get your help without letting you know what the organization is about.
- Yes i believe we have a couple more turns left so I'll educate you more on where your donation is going.
- That's 25% of the HIT.
- I have to admit these mturk studies don't even pay you enough for a cup of coffee.
- I believe this completes my part of the study.
- I feel inspired!
- Sorry to hear about your financial troubles!
- I've been in a similar boat recently.
- I have to get going.
- $2 I think
- I live in Florida.
- North Carolina is nice I have been there once.
- Please explain to me in detail
- I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend.
- I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday.
- I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do.
- Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns.
- Can I tell you all
- sorry it cut me off...
- I was going to ask you the same.
- I am so glas!
- Yes, very bad.
- Oh, that is something for me too.
- what's the website,  might look it up
- Thanks i will, i think thats 10 too
- Wow!
- John Cena is amazing.
- So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?
- I like how these HITs give the opportunity to talk about charities
- Dpo you about Save the Children organizatio
- I think it is.
- Same here.
- That is why I am up so early.
- Wow!
- hehe, I meant rather then lining someones pocket....
- good karma....
- maybe you'll be lucky today ;)
- I guess I should get into what this chat is supposed to be about.
- Yes you can write them letters and they can write you back, thanks!
- eso estaria muy bien, entre todos podemos ayudar, la mayoria de los demas trabajadores  donaran todo su pago, estos ni??Â¸?Â£?os estaran agradecidos
- But I think UNO and UNICEF can contribute a lot if they desired to do so.
- Yes UNO and UNICEF is included this things more.
- We do what we can and help something we can for the poor childrens
- Oh really?
- Oh, one little thing.
- 5 cents it is.
- I imagine a lot of people end up doing these hits.
- It probably adds up, assuming everyone pitches in a little.
- I'd assume so.
- I've done hits kind of like this, where the end goal seemed to be to gauge peoples charitable giving with their task payments.
- I'm a sucker for helping people when I can.
- You too!
- It is a huge problem to them but you and I do not have that problem huh?
- Do you live in the United States?
- Me too!
- I am going to Kenya in December and I may try to see if there is anywhere there that I can donate some money.
- Wait, I should just go through Save the Children since I know they are reputable.
- Exactly!
- yes we know this and they run the country but that is the virtues of a free nation
- so now what
- I'm not completely sure about that.
- Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world
- Sure thing!
- Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.
- I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you
- Okay got it!
- That is such a great organization isn't it?
- Was it a one time donation or continuous?
- Great!
- it is so hard to make a choice
- wish that we could, but like all working on MTurk we are poor ourselves
- yes that is so true, so often it is just left to governments to do
- Oh gosh you totally can.
- I'm pretty sure its Save the Children because it says it on my side
- It will through the researchers they promised
- Yes I am fine with that
- I'm in the United States.
- I live in Indiana.
- The weather is totally hit or miss.
- Right now it's in the 90's and sooo humid!
- Indiana is so flat and really all looks the same.
- We have a lot of farmers here.
- So it's true, there is a lot of corn in Indiana. lol
- But I do get it.
- How is NY?
- I would love to travel there one day.
- I bet everything is so over priced.
- I figured!
- IN is really conservative.
- I hope so.
- Of course.
- Me too.
- No I haven't heard of it
- Yes, I was really surprised too.
- Yes, I think they are great.
- Glad your week is starting off well.
- Just think.
- I see, same here for me.
- I know right, It is a big thing to do.
- You can do either.
- I'm so sorry, what a terrible thing.
- Well not being short, that's fine.
- FINE, HOW ABOUT YOU, AND MANY CHILDREN ARE DYING.
- I DO NOT THE OTHER CHARITIES.
- i guess were done here
- Oh.
- 16.00s was agreed.
- :)
- ;) and haha!
- It is disturbing!
- I hear that.
- I wish more people would.
- I'm proud too.
- Just do not to the other side
- Yes they will.
- Aren\'t you glad you helped today?
- ok fine...
- Ok...
- Fine...
- Fine...
- nice to hear this from you...
- Wow, What is the specialty in your place?
- your welcome...
- please spread the good thoughts about children's charity...
- Ok.
- I just had a thought on my mind that I wanted to ask you about
- I was thinking about how everywhere you go, they ask you to donate .50 here and your change there.
- I am!
- Oh man, I can't believe it!
- There are lots of opportunities
- most people aren't very generous even when faced with facts about others who are worse off.
- ha.
- i shouldn't laugh, but you are right.
- that's a great goal.
- Little typo there, Save the Children.
- I would be glad to.
- It is early in the morning on the East Coast of the USA where I am.
- Where are you located
- Well we are up early.
- This chat is really I think to talk about various charities and activities.
- Amazing outcome and we still get a good payment
- I think HIT donation is a good thin since websites usually have minimum payment option, but on HITs we can donate 1 cent or more, makes it so much easier.
- That is so sweet.
- I've learnt it from you.
- I will do the same since now.
- Thanks for your attention and help.
- May all children live in health and happiness.
- Oh, I see, this conversation has to go for 10 turns EACH.
- Yeah, I mistimed that.
- That's on me.
- Yeah.
- Such is Mturk life.
- Haha, touche. GL
- It is definitely a beautiful morning.
- A great day to be out volunteering for a cause.
- I am headed out to do some community work today.
- I know this may seem a bit forward and I do apologize as I do not mean to offend.
- Well I should be getting off here soon.
- The beautiful day outside is calling for me and the carnival starts soon.
- I will tell everyone about you today!
- I believe your bonus is $1.70
- Hold ten?
- Sorry, typo!!
- I'm sorry my last message was cut off.
- Can I count on you then?
- No problem thank you
- You are a scallywag ninny!
- Well, it's something.
- Let's do it, then.
- Other than the satisfaction of helping a child in need?!
- However, I think $25 would be more beneficial and it would go to so many good causes.
- Have you been using MTurk long?
- I've only just started in the last few days and I love it.
- It's pretty easy money most of the time.
- I'm Tommy, by the way.
- Well thanks, Cassidy.
- It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.
- How about you, Cassidy?
- Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.
- The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know?
- Did you know that there is an option to do that for this HIT?
- How about you?
- no of course, what you need to know?
- Where are you from?
- I'm learning about this myself now, too.
- Me too!
- Me too, this was neat.
- If you say ASAP.
- So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.
- If you have the time, I would like to talk with you about a charity.
- Well, I suppose it depends on what you mean by a reward.
- Right?
- They seem like a good charity.
- I can certainly understand where you are coming from, and family does come first.
- You are a part of the solution and you do not have to hope it is helpful.
- If I had all the control, the only money not spent on the children would be for fundraising.
- Oh my goodness, that is great news!
- Would you like a minute to g over it, I can wait while you do.
- I have two.
- I guess having had children the St Judes hospital makes you think what if and what would i do
- I will look in to donating my time locally, thank you!
- I tried that approach and you disregarded me and told me another time.
- I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!
- I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.
- it means a lot
- I am doing this for charity.
- This is for a good cause.
- It good to stand by your word and giving to the children.
- I am just now watching the news about the hurricane in Hawaii and seeing the damage already done.
- I have been looking into ways to help.
- Wow!
- So yes you can less
- I know I have.
- I completely agree!
- I am not sure what you are talking about.
- Also, please include the $ sign to avoid confusion.
- Yes, I am as well.
- Yes, I do as well.
- Great to hear that you like our mission statement!
- I have exciting news for you.
- Wonderful!
- This is so exciting to us.
- Sounds fantastic.
- Is it okay to go ahead and charge your credit card today, or would you prefer to mail a check?
- That's what happens.
- Oh, that sounds nice.
- Yes, I agree, it is sad.
- And thanks for asking me too.
- Yes, I am sure that is it.
- it's great,I can't complain
- Are donating as well?
- I would love too...
- yes they are..
- Can you confirm your donation in a number amount with the $ sign, just to avoid confusion?
- Ooops, it looks like it did not show up, can you try again?
- Yes!
- Yes I can!
- That worked out.
- I was as well!
- Even it's 5 dollars
- That's true also
- Yes me too
- The whole task amount isn't much to us but would be so much to them but I understand.
- I totally understand about having to support a family too.
- I know I was surprised by those numbers.
- That's important to me in a charity.
- Oh yeah.
- I would be too, It is not easy to trust these days
- It is!
- I'm sorry.
- That's great news, you know they are untrustworthy.
- Oh my goodness I meant to say trustworthy.
- That's why we don't have extra money.
- But I guess once in a while we should donate to real children LOL .
- Lmao!
- Deal!!!
- I guess we have to each have 10 turns so after this response we have to write two more times LOL
- Not really but I've been to one of their games.
- It was fun.
- Are you?
- Clementine and Eddybear.
- And they are tired of me messing around on the computer so after the survey we are going to go for a walk!!
- I think we took ten turns!
- It's really hot here too.
- Okay I'll put it in my quarter if you put in yours and have an awesome day!!
- Very much so!
- That's great.
- You should have the option coming up to help you make a donation.
- Do how much are you donating
- but it never reached to the people i heard so far
- From what I have learned, by donating $500, another organization will match the donation with a minimum $500 donation.
- I happen to agree!
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- I have.
- Of course.
- Of course not.
- That's very commendable
- Awesome..
- How do you end this study.
- The rest?
- It is.
- That is great!
- Wow!
- ok tell me
- Yes that is a great idea.
- we have to chat so ask a question
- I think I have heard of it.
- Yes I love that too.
- I completely understand that.
- We are all trying to survive in life.
- Feel free to check out
- Oh no, you are awesome.
- No need to be sorry.
- You have not been a waste of time at all.
- good, i take care of insurance and I like my job
- you donate for this children
- Glad to hear it.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I understand.
- I agree, it really is.
- What do you say?
- i'm not sure i already donate my time.
- This is the most popular donation.
- Would you like to set up a one time donation for $30 or would you prefer to do it monthly? We can accept all major credit cards and Paypal for your convenience.
- Which would you prefer?
- How would you like to make payment for this donation?
- We can accept all major credit cards and Paypal for your convenience.
- It is a great choice.
- All I need is your Paypal email and I will submit a request for the donation so that all you have to do is accept it.
- Does that sound ok to you?
- Unfortunately, there are way too many scam companies out there
- I have a special, special request for a special person like you.
- Well, less is okay, but to help the maximum amount of kids then a maximum amount would be good.
- If you can stomach more then go for it!
- Actually, I'm really troubled by the answer.
- It wants me to donate to "Save the Children".
- I'm not sure how much my $0.30 reward for completing the HIT would actually help.
- It doesn't say that in the info they gave me.
- It is only paying you $0.20 complete the HIT?
- So how is .10 half?
- Well it's cool that you are using mTurk.
- ok, I will get it out to as soon as possible!
- Ha, well maybe not the best example currently...
- Okay, then I have an option for you.
- That is why I'm talking to you today.
- Of course you can donate to other charities.
- It's not necessarily a zero-sum game.
- So we'll agree then: you can do both!
- the ones that help children specifically
- I went to the website and looked up the actual numbers.
- Would you like to take a few minutes to go over the website first before you commit?
- It is the least we can do.
- So I just looked it up and they do a lot of work for children around the world.
- It seems vaguely familiar but I never paid attention specifically.
- From what I'm reading, it sounds like a great cause
- I'm usually pretty busy so try to donate a little here and there.
- My family has been involved with charities due to our business.
- We make regular donations and Save the Children actually has done the most with what we've given them.
- It's mind blowing.
- Neither of us are donating to each other actually, which is probably a good thing.

 ## intent:personal-story
- I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.
- I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.
- If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.
- The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.
- I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.
- I'm not a fan of charities that keep a lot of their proceeds for themselves.
- That's one reason I really like this one.
- I grew up worrying about my safety and whether I'd have a place to live.
- My dad was a gambling addict.
- Thank you.
- I really appreciate your sympathizing, and I'm glad I got to share that with someone.
- I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.
- My friend had refer me.
- She volunteers for them.
- I saw a children died from hunger and it tears my heart apart.
- I decide to be part of the solution since then
- I personally have family in Haiti.
- I remember when I donated, the foundation sent me an update about how one of the patients was doing.
- It felt great to see a little reflection of what my donation was helping to do.
- Sometimes I think about the little things I buy.
- Like yesterday I had a craving for candy so I bought a bag of smarties for $2.79.
- Sometimes I wonder how much it could help someone else instead of just satisfying my cravings.
- I have only been to Mexico and that was an eye opener.
- One dollar is so valuable to them.
- It is crazy!
- I remember a kid that lives on the streets.
- He has no parents ,no one that cares about him
- I get in touch with the Save the Children program.
- They get him a house and warm food
- I try to donate a couple of times per year, especially around the holidays.
- I have felt great in the past about this and will continue in the future.
- I donate a portion of each of my paychecks to them automatically
- For the past 3 or 4 years
- I try to do what I can, but its hard sometimes
- My brother, sister, and I replaced birthday gifts with charity donations a few years ago.
- It saved on clutter and felt great to give to charities.
- I have been to other countries that are very poor and it is Amazing how much a little donation will make a BIG differance in these childrens lives.
- I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts.
- There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help.
- I've donated $ 100 to this organization, sorry
- i am a person positive and help the children
- My uncle used to be located there but he's moved since
- But the good news is that STC is already  ready to help out!
- I went on and looked around.
- They are helping so many that otherwise would be starving.
- I have kids and a few nieces and nephews, and lots of cousins too!.
- It would really break my heart to see them suffer.
- I take in children in need who would otherwise do without.
- Right now I have 3 extra kids.
- I like the organization that are transparent with their financial reports, specially the ones that collaborate with big companies.
- I just donate here and there.
- I have donated to organization that works on some disease through MTurk, like Malaria
- I got involved with thei website.
- After knowing how hard they work I was really impressed.
- I know I have kids and if they were suffering and unable to eat it would just tear me apart.
- I do funds when first i saw one poor children looking for his food and he did not received after that i am thinking why i can help to other poor peoples and i willed to donate some funds to some poor peoples and charities
- I know I always feel so selfish when I'm eating lunch and I see a commercial for people who are starving, it just really gets to me and I'm so glad you care about making a difference as well!
- It made me feel good to know that I could provide some type of help especially because I have children of my own.
- I know if my child was in need I would hope people like us would make a donation - no matter how small.
- I've been involved with the organization for about a year now and have learned so much about their mission.
- They help children here at home and abroad
- I help promote the organization by speaking to people just like you and helping to generate donations.
- Since the organization is not for profit, donations from individuals and organizations help them acheive their mission
- YEs I always look into the charities that i donate to.
- For instance I always donate to our local childrens hospital because my nephew was treat there when he was diagnosed with cancer.
- I saw how many sick little kids where there fight for their lives.
- So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children.
- 1 has a lot of  health issues so childrens charities are always important to me.
- Yes, probably but my nephew got sick before I had kids and thats what made me realize that cancer or any illness can happen to anyone whether its your child or some one close to you.
- It is the scariest thing that can happen to anyone especially a child.
- Once I saw how many children were fighting cancer and other serious disease it woke me up to what is important in life and just because we are not going through it there are so many children suffering that the least I can do is donate.
- I do actually, because they're the reason my parents were able to come to America.
- I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.
- I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.
- I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.
- I am not a member, but i donate.
- I have three children myself, and the welfare of children around the world is a very important cause to me.
- I prefer monthly, just so it fits in my budget easier.
- My friend is a nurse and she takes a month off every year to go to Africa to help out.
- I would love to do that but can't possibly get that much time off.
- I know there are often times I regret spending money on that when there are starving kids in the world that could be helped.
- It's a very rewarding experience.
- A productive activity to fill your free time with.
- And it feels incredible knowing that I have been a part of something greater than myself.
- It really helps you shift your perspective about your own personal significance on this planet.
- You realize how infinitely important you are and yet at the same time how infinitely important another person is.
- When you have the ability to literally change another person's life with something so small...
- wow, it's life changing.
- I recently have become acquainted with a charity that is actually doing everything we have discussed and is seeing some real results!
- For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.
- My nephew had to get taken into the hospital not too long ago and I just got the letter in the mail saying they used Save the Childrens donation money to help him.
- We found out the hard way that he has actual celiacs (sorry I can't spell too well) and he has an allergic reaction to the cake on his birthday.
- He went through a TON of testing and that's how they caught it.
- He has to stay overnight at the hospital for a few weeks and his parents just couldn't afford it.
- That's when Save the Children came around to help
- They helped cover the bills for it since he's in Africa.
- He's doing much better now though!
- Yeah, I'm just so glad that I know they really help.
- I'm back in the UK now - I was in South Africa (Durban for three months from January to end of March) for work.
- I work with children primarily from underprivileged families or no families at all.
- I do the same but also get involved regularly.
- Today, for instance, is our End of Summer Carnival for the kids.
- Its one of our largest fundraisers of the year.
- I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.
- Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.
- I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.
- It's really sweet.
- I really like them, I've volunteered for them before.
- I rather put my money into this charity then church offering because I know it directly helps children.
- A year ago, I saw kid begging on the street who look really hungry.
- I was about to give him some money until a representative for "Save the Children" walked ahead of me and help this kid out.
- This person took them to their facility and provided food, shelter, and clothing.
- A month later I saw the kid was healthier, happy, and cleaner.
- I have problems too.
- I see children everyday even in my community who do not have enough to eat and they are not able to afford to go to the doctor.
- The only meal they get are the free meals from school.
- I personally haven't ever dealt with them, I have just seen a lot of commercials and heard about the organization for many years.
- Yes, I have heard that about them too.
- I have thought about donating before, but never got around to it.
- I have heard about a great charity, and I was going to ask if you are interested.
- I feel really good about helping.
- I donate money to places, but I have not donated time.
- I would love to help as well.
- I looked at the site.
- I went on today and really learned a lot.
- I like children
- I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can.
- I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses.
- I think the work that charities can do is so important.
- But after doing this task and reading up on the website I am going to sign up.
- I love to do charity work.
- I also do alot of local volunteer work.
- Any way I can help a defenseless child I will.
- I always place my own child in their shoes.
- That's motivation enough... to picture my babies going through what these kids go through.
- When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.
- I myself have a soft heart for children and usually help the charities for children.
- I am planning to donate.
- I heard about this organization few weeks ego on MTurk, and i too k the time to read about it.
- It took my attention and I donated on the last HITs i did
- I am careful when I want to donate too
- I donated before and surprisingly it did not even hurt my reward.
- I thought it will
- I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports
- I don't either, and when I do I usually donate to dog charities.
- I have donated :-)
- I remember being in a group home as a kid, and a bunch of ladies had made blankets and hats for us.
- I still have the blanket I was made to this day!
- I donate money to save the children
- I have been donating money to save the children for 5 years.
- I give them 1000 dollars every year.
- I give each end of the year $ 100 in the help of these children
- I am a teacher, so I have a lot of compassion
